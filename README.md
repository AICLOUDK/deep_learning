# Deep Learing
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on building and training artificial neural networks with multiple layersâ€”hence the term "deep." These networks are designed to automatically learn and extract features from large amounts of data, enabling them to perform complex tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.

Neural Networks: Inspired by the human brain, neural networks consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

Layers: 

Input Layer: Receives the raw data.
Hidden Layers: Process data through weighted connections, progressively extracting higher-level features.
Output Layer: Produces the final result or prediction.
Training: The network learns by adjusting weights based on the error between its predictions and the actual data, using algorithms like backpropagation and gradient descent.

Advantages: Deep learning models can handle unstructured data (like images, audio, text) and often achieve high accuracy in complex tasks.

Applications: Facial recognition, language translation, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and more.
